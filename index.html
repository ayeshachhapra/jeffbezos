                While still in high school, Bezos developed the Dream Institute, a centre that promoted creative
                thinking in young students. After graduating (1986) summa cum laude from Princeton University with
                degrees in electrical engineering and computer science, he undertook a series of jobs before joining the
                New York investment bank D.E. Shaw & Co. in 1990. Soon named senior vice president—the firm’s
                youngest—Bezos was in charge of examining the investment possibilities of the Internet. Its enormous
                potential—Web usage was growing by more than 2,000 percent a year—sparked his entrepreneurial
                imagination. In 1994 he quit D.E. Shaw and moved to Seattle, Washington, to open a virtual bookstore.
                Working out of his garage with a handful of employees, Bezos began developing the software for the site.
                Named after the South American river, Amazon sold its first book in July 1995. <br>
                Amazon quickly became the leader in e-commerce. Open 24 hours a day, the site was user-friendly,
                encouraging browsers to post their own reviews of books and offering discounts, personalized
                recommendations, and searches for out-of-print books. In June 1998 it began selling CDs, and later that
                year it added videos. In 1999 Bezos added auctions to the site and invested in other virtual stores. The
                success of Amazon encouraged other retailers, including major book chains, to establish online stores.
                <br>
                As more companies battled for Internet dollars, Bezos saw the need to diversify, and by 2005 Amazon
                offered a vast array of products, including consumer electronics, apparel, and hardware. Amazon
                diversified even further in 2006 by introducing Amazon Web Services (AWS), a cloud-computing service
                that eventually became the largest such service in the world. In late 2007 Amazon released a new
                handheld reading device called the Kindle, a digital book reader with wireless Internet connectivity,
                enabling customers to purchase, download, read, and store a vast selection of books on demand. Amazon
                announced in 2010 that sales of Kindle books had surpassed those of hardcover books. That same year
                Amazon moved into making its own television shows and movies with its Amazon Studios division. Amazon’s
                yearly net sales increased from $510,000 in 1995 to some $600 million in 1998 and from more than $19.1
                billion in 2008 to almost $233 billion in 2018. About half of the company’s operating income in 2018 was
                derived from AWS. Two years later Amazon registered record profits, and its revenue in the fourth
                quarter that year surpassed $100 billion for the first time. The unprecedented numbers were, in part,
                caused by a rise in home shopping during the COVID-19 <br>
                In 1993 Bezos married Mackenzie Tuttle, whom he had met at D.E. Shaw. The couple announced in January
                2019 that they were divorcing, and the following day the National Enquirer printed a story revealing
                that Bezos was having an affair with another woman. Bezos subsequently launched an investigation into
                how the tabloid had obtained his private text messages. Then, in February, he posted a lengthy essay
                online in which he accused officials at American Media Inc. (AMI), the parent company of the Enquirer,
                of “extortion and bribery” for suggesting that they would release nude photographs of Bezos if he did
                not stop his inquiry, amid other demands. The Bezos-led investigation later alleged that his lover’s
                brother had leaked the texts. <br>
                Jeff Bezos is an American technology entrepreneur and founder of e-commerce giant Amazon.com. Born to
                Jacklyn Gise and Ted Jorgensen, he was adopted by Miguel Bezos, a Cuban immigrant, after his mother
                married him. As a child, he spent his summers laying pipes, vaccinating cattle and fixing windmills at
                his grandfather’s Texas ranch. He attended Miami Palmetto Senior High School, and took his B.Sc. degree
                in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Princeton University graduating ‘summa cum laude’.
                He worked on Wall Street in companies such as Fitel, Bankers Trust and D. E. Shaw & Co, New York. He
                became the youngest Vice President at D. E. Shaw & Co. In spite of success, he decided to quit the field
                of finance. He founded Amazon.com, an online book store, and later introduced features including
                one-click shopping, customer reviews, and e-mail order verification. He expanded it to include various
                other items including clothes, CDs, toys, jewellery, watches, electronics and shoes. He has constantly
                been improving his web site, and introducing improved facilities for his customers. His childhood dream
                of space travel spurred the founding of Blue Origin, an aerospace company that is developing
                technologies to offer space travel to customers. Bloomberg Billionaires Index listed Bezos as one of the
                wealthiest people in the world with an estimated net worth of $28 billion.
